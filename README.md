# self-driving-car
This project involves an autonomous vehicle system. The system integrates:
Lane detection and curve estimation for precise navigation.
Traffic sign detection and recognition.
Traffic light detection and recognition.
Object detection for obstacle avoidance.
Drowsy face recognition to ensure driver alertness.

The system will activate an alarm if the driver is drowsy, prompting them to enable automatic driving mode for their safety. If the driver agrees, the auto-driving mode will be activated with the aforementioned features.
